0.2.4
- use an absolute path to create an empty logfile
- make installation possible, even if distribute / setuptools is not installed

0.2.3
- make sure that the directories exist where the logfile is located

0.2.2
- fix install for easy_install and pip users

0.2.1
- add the python package "argparse" to the list of requirements if it is not
  installed yet

0.2
- use a global configuration file if it can be found as the default
  configuration for new projects
- added the subcommand "quickstart"
- print more useful error messages, e.g. if a source file mentioned in a
  template cannot be found
- added support for the template engines Mako, Jinja2 and Genshi:
  - Genshi:
    - added the configuration options "method" (can be either "html" or
    "xhtml") and "doctype" to specify the behaviour of rendering
  - Jinja2
    - added the following configuration options:
      - block_start_string
      - block_end_string
      - variable_start_string
      - variable_end_string
      - comment_start_string
      - comment_end_string
      - trim_blocks
  - see http://jinja.pocoo.org/api/#jinja2.Environment for their meanings and
    default values
- renamed the section "local configuration" in the project-dependent
  config.ini to "general"
- interpret also short filename extensions of sources (new filename
  extensions: *.rst for ReST, *.md for Markdown, and *.tt for Textile)

0.1
- fixed many bugs
- added many tests and improved the existing ones
- source files can have titles now (it is highly recommended that you set a
  title for each source file; the fallback for titleless source files will
  generate a rather useless title (it simply takes the first five words of the
  source file's first line))
- print a progressbar during the rednering process
- create required directories and an empty logfile directly after the
  installation process
- the encoding UTF-8 for reading template files and source files is used
- additional packages from PyPi are required: texttable, py and logbook
- added logging features:
  - new global CLI option -l --logfile determines the location of the logfile
    (default is $XDG_DATA_HOME/swsg/swsg.log if this environment variable is
    set; otherwise it is ~/.local/share/swsg/swsg.log
  - new global CLI options -v --verbose and -d --debug set the logging levels
    where the debug option will overwrite the verbose option in the case where
    both are set
- general changes to the command line interface (swsg-cli):
  - added many help messages to arguments and options
  - new CLI argument "list-projects" lists all created projects in a pretty
    ASCII table
  - added an argument for removing projects: remove-project path/to/the/project
  - added a function to validate the use of the argument change-config: an error
    message is written to STDERR and the script will be quit if neither a markup
    language nor a template language was given
  - restricted the set of possible values for the options --markup-language and
    --template-language for the argument change-config

0.1a
- initial release
