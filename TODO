- General
  - provide more interfaces (GTK+, Qt, CLI, (curses), (web), PIDA-Plugin)

- Preferences
  - project-dependent configuration (config.ini in the project directory):
    - boolean config item: guess markup language by filetype?
      -> use the configuration value if set to False

- Templates:
  - function ``sitemap`` gets the parameters depth, exclude
  - function ``breadcrumbs``
  - add a possibility for the user to add / register custom template functions!

- sources:
  - virtual folders (directories), implemented as a datastructure (JSON):
    - example content::

        [
          "source 1",
	  {"folder 1":
	    ["source 1.1", "source 1.2"]
	  },
	  "source 2",
	  "source 3",
	  {"folder 2":
	    {"folder 2.1": ["source 2.1"]}
	  }
        ]

    - makes it possible to offer handy functions which yield the hierarchical
      structure with titles and targets so one can use these values in a
      template engine in navigations

- GUI:
  - multiple files (doesn't matter if content files, *.css or templates) can be
    opened via multiple tabs
  - source structure
    - support re-ordering and moving via D&D
    - create a new folder with a button or the context menu
  - menu bar:
    - Projects
      - New project...
      - Open project...
    - Preview
      - live-preview (with emphasis on *live*!)
        - open the file index.(x)html **with the user's standard webbrowser**
    - Render
    - Preferences

- low priority:
  - trash bin for Projects, Templates and Sources
    - the classes ``Project``, ``Template``, and ``Source`` get the property
      (a getter) ``exists``
    - there are two additional properties:
      - the setter ``delete`` sets the attribute ``exists`` to ``False``
      - the setter ``undelete`` sets the attribute ``exists`` to ``True``
      -> log a warning if the user tries to do one of the following actions:
           - delete an already deleted object
           - undelete an existing object
  - man page for the CLI of swsg; is the -h --help option not enough?!
  - i18n support
  - support a HAML-like template language beside usual HTML for the templates
