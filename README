About
swsg (static web site generator) is a tool to create static websites using
human-readable markup languages like ReST. It was highly-inspired by SR
(http://bitbucket.org/tiax/sr/overview). The advantage of SWSG against directly
using (X)HTML files is that you have one (or more) templates and do not
have to rewrite every your main layout on ebery single site. You can concentrate
on the main content: the text; the content is seperated from the templates.

Features
- supports many markup languages: Markdown, Creole, Textile, ReST
- supports many template engines: Jinja2, Mako, Genshi, and also a very simple
  template language for those who do not need control structures like loops or
  if-conditions -> only the simple template language is supported yet.
- supports clevercss and sass beside the usual CSS as a markup language for the
  stylesheets -> not yet!
- provides multiple interfaces: until now, only a CLI is implemented, but others
  are planned:
    - PIDA-Plugin (PIDA: http://pida.co.uk/)
    - web interface
    - possibly a GTK+ or Qt application, but I think using the PIDA-Plugin is
      more comfortable

Requirements
- Python -> http://python.org/download
  - either version 2.7 or version 2.6 with the python package argparse
    (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse) installed
- at least one of the following markup languages, installed as a python package:
  - ReST (the corresponding python package is called "docutils")
      -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils
  - markdown -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown
  - creole -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/creole
  - textile -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile
- optional: one or more of the following template engines, also installed as
  python packages:
  - Jinja2 -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Jinja2/
  - Mako -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Mako
  - Genshi -> http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Genshi

Installation
There are currently two ways to install SWSG on your system, whereas both of
them need administrator previleges to be performed (to make it clear: only one
of the following actions is necessary!):
1. enter "python setup.py install" in a terminal (the file setup.py is the file
   which can be found in the same directory as this README file)
2. Use easy_install (http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html) by
   typing "easy_install swsg"
