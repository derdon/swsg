About
swsg (static web site generator) is a tool to create static websites using
human-readable markup languages like ReST. It was highly-inspired by SR
(http://bitbucket.org/tiax/sr/overview). The advantage of SWSG against directly
using (X)HTML files is that you have one (or more) templates and do not
have to rewrite every your main layout on ebery single site. You can concentrate
on the main content: the text; the content is seperated from the templates.

Features
- supports many markup languages: Markdown, Creole, Textile, ReST
- supports many template engines: Jinja2, Mako, Genshi, and also a very simple
  template language for those who do not need control structures like loops or
  if-conditions
- supports clevercss and sass beside the usual CSS as a markup language for the
  stylesheets
- provides multiple interfaces: until now, only a CLI is implemented, but others
  are planned:
    - PIDA-Plugin (PIDA: http://pida.co.uk/)
    - web interface
    - possibly a GTK+ or Qt application, but I think using the PIDA-Plugin is
      more comfortable

  - either version 2.7 or version 2.6 with the python package argparse
